    <p style="color:#dddddd;text-align:center";>
        Over the past few years, I have took on both graphic design and photography as a hobbie. 
        With the enjoyment and satisfaction I had with this, I decided that I wanted my future to 
        include these same hobbies. When I came across the program called, "User Experience Design", 
        I saw potential to further my knowledge on both design and technology.

            For this project, my group was given the task to “hack” the traditional concept of a box. 
            This meant that we needed to manipulate the box in a way that it became far more useful for 
            any common user. This was an immediate challenge as there was not a ton of room for creativity, 
            as we were restricted to a box and reusable materials. We needed to find a way to turn this box 
            into an effective and engaging product that a user would find both effective and efficient for 
            use. That is why we created the Compact Desk Box. There has been countless times where I have 
            small items and have no realistic place to store them without forgetting where they are. With 
            this product, there are multiple, differently coloured storage units that help with desk 
            organization, while still looking aesthetically pleasing.

        <p style="color:#dddddd;text-align:center";>
            As our first big project as group, I feel as though it taught us a lot about what it means to 
            be a “maker”. We understood how important the ideation phase was to our overall design as we 
            all generated ideas together for hours on end. With all of this teamwork, we were bound to 
            create something that can be both useful and effective in virtually any household. As a group 
            of amateur UX Designers, we began to understand what it really means to work as a team and that 
            every idea can generate conversation on more ideas. I am very proud of how well we worked 
            together and how useful the final product turned out and I am grateful that I not only got the 
            work with fantastic people, but I also got to appreciate and recognize what “making” is.

                For the second Group Maker Project, we were challenged with the task designing a product 
                that can effectively address a social issue of concern. There are numerous social issues 
                ongoing in society but the one that stood out the most to us was public health. With the 
                progressing issue of COVID-19 we knew we needed to create something that can keep people 
                safe and at home. Coming up with something that would physically keep somebody safe was 
                difficult, so we decided to formulate a product that would instead encourage people to 
                stay at home. That is how we came up with the idea of the Plug N’ Play Projector.
            </p>

            <p style="color:#dddddd;text-align:center";>
                There was a lot to take away from this project after the completion of our final prototype. 
                Despite the long process of actually coming up with this idea, we were able to brainstorm 
                together to create a product that successfully addresses multiple social issues of concern.
                I was mentored by William when creating 3D model of the Plug N’ Play Projector, as he has a 
                lot of experience when it comes to modelling and passed his knowledge onto me. 3D modeling 
                is an important skill to learn in the field of UX, so I am grateful that I had the 
                opportunity to gain some proficiency within this skill. Teamwork was once again a huge 
                factor in our success. Communication was key and we were able to understand each others 
                ideas and generate further ideas off of those. I am very happy with how the final product 
                turned out. It looks aesthetically pleasing and attractive to users and is extremely useful 
                and functional in virtually any household.

              The Paper Airplane Making Guide Assignment was an introduction to what exactly we would be 
              doing throughout the Maker Lab course. Our goal was to explain is explicit detail how to
              make the perfect paper airplane. As easy as this sounds, it simply was not. Crafting a paper
              airplane can be an easy task for most individuals, however, if an individual does not know
              the procedure of constructing one, then a detailed step by step guide with images is needed.
              There could be absolutely no mistakes within this guide and the reader should never have to
              read over a step again to understand it. To ensure this, images of each fold were included to
              be sure that the user was following along.

                This assignment was a great way to get us in the habit of explaining how we do things. Not
                only just explaining, but iterating with great detail on how we made what we did. The skills
                that I have learned from this assignment can be carried with me throughout the rest of 
                University and in my future career, as precision and detailed are extremely important.

                The Laurier Course Registration Re-Design is one of the largest projects I have done to this day.
                It is was a semester long project that consisted of continuous communication with not only my team
                members, but also with the clients we were designing for. This project was a representation of what
                a User Experience Designer would be doing in the real world and showed me how to communicate with
                clients professionally. These skills are essential and I have learned how to keep in touch with clients
                in order to keep them up to date on how the project is going, what needs to be changed and what their
                opinions are.

                  Above are a few examples of the photos I have taken in recent months. Photography is a
                  true passion of mine, as it allows me to use my creativity to its fully potential.
                  Portraits have always been my favourite type of photo as I can alter my surroundings and
                  my models in order to create a photo that both myself and the model is happy with.
                  Photography is always going to be an important skill to have and not only for just modelling.
                  With photography, I can take photos of products, then use my skills within Photoshop, 
                  Illustrator, Premier, etc. to create advertisements for businesses that want their product
                  to look visually appealing to potential future users.
